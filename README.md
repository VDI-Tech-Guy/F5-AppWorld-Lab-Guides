# F5-AppWorld-Lab-Guides

This repository contains the lab guides for F5 AppWorld Labs.

All content is written in [reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html), then transformed into HTML using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator with some help from [Docutils](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/). You must install Docutils and its dependencies (Python) to render the reStructuredText content format.

If you are looking to contribute, please see [Contributing](/CONTRIBUTE.md) to get started with a guide on how Hugo works, how routes are managed, and how to start your Hugo site locally.
